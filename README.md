## About Us
Scarcity is bad.  So let's fix that.

Traditionally, it costs somewhere between $20 and $150 to create decent character art for your concept. The process involves a long back and forth with an artist and someone, somewhere has to do a lot of work to make it. Thankfully, magic happened and now we have computer artists that can take dreams and realize them in seconds. However, these AI artists aren't perfect and it can take a fair bit of effort to make something that actually looks good. Once you do though... you can make a ton of it.

That's where we come in. We've studied, tweaked and combined AI magic to make art that's perfect for tabletop games. Furthermore, we've generated a whole bunch of art and made it easy to search so that you can quickly find something that's gorgeous and matches your vision.

And it's all out there for free.

The team behind Melvin's Mechanical Masterworks is doing their darndest to make it so there is enough tabletop art that everyone can enjoy as much as they want of it.

That's right. The art we put out there is free for you to download and use in your games or anywhere else. Though if you want to pitch in and see what else we can create together, we certainly wouldn't mind.

After all, a gnome's gotta eat.

### F.A.Q.

#### Where is Melvin's Masterworks?

In any FilePicker for which you have upload permissions, a paintbrush icon will be in the top right corner which launches the Workshop application. When importing images from Melvin's Workshop, they will be placed in the currently active folder of the FilePicker the workshop was launched from. See the following video for a quick demonstration.

#### How do I get the best search results?

Our database is vast and one person's trash is another's treasure, so knowing how to best utilize our searching methods will help get you to that _perfect_ image more quickly.

##### Example Search Workflow

1. I am looking for an elderly barkeep, without many other specifications. I select the "Portrait" category and search with "elderly barkeep" with the similarity slider at its default value ("least").
2. I get a scattershot of results, one or two catches my eye and I click on each one and add to favorites (right click selected image is a shortcut for this).  However, neither are exactly what I'm looking for.
3. I click one of the favorited images and click "Portrait Search" again -- the similarity slider drops by one notch, and results are _more_ similar to my selected image.
4. Seeing a better image than my current selection, I select that image, and click search again. This time, the similarity slider stays at its current value because we are not "digging into" a the same image, but rather "moving laterally" to a neighbor.
5. Repeat steps 2-4, adding and removing favorited images as better ones are found.

#### What is Artoe's Laminator?

Artoe's Laminator is our image cropping and token creation tool, integrated directly into the Melvin's Workshop application. Use either Melvin's database, pre-packaged token borders (only a very small built-in sample of our _massive_ token border collection), or assets local to your FoundryVTT server.  See the video below for an example of its use.

_Note: example video recorded on a previous version of Artoe's Laminator -- UI and specific workflows may be different_
