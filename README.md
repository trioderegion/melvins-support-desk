## About Us
Scarcity is bad.  So let's fix that.

Traditionally, it costs somewhere between $20 and $150 to create decent character art for your concept. The process involves a long back and forth with an artist and someone, somewhere has to do a lot of work to make it. Thankfully, magic happened and now we have computer artists that can take dreams and realize them in seconds. However, these AI artists aren't perfect and it can take a fair bit of effort to make something that actually looks good. Once you do though... you can make a ton of it.

That's where we come in. We've studied, tweaked and combined AI magic to make art that's perfect for tabletop games. Furthermore, we've generated a whole bunch of art and made it easy to search so that you can quickly find something that's gorgeous and matches your vision.

And it's all out there for free.

The team behind Melvin's Mechanical Masterworks is doing their darndest to make it so there is enough tabletop art that everyone can enjoy as much as they want of it.

That's right. The art we put out there is free for you to download and use in your games or anywhere else. Though if you want to pitch in and see what else we can create together, we certainly wouldn't mind.

After all, a gnome's gotta eat.
